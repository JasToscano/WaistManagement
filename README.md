Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed was a weight tracking application designed to store inputted user information. The requirements involved implementing 3 tables: one to store the daily weight, one for user logins and passwords, and one to store the users goal weight. There also included a need for multiple navigation buttons and screens for logging in, a display of the weight grid, and mechanisms to add a dialy weight, goal weight, and a notification for when the user reached their goal weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Features necessary to be featured initially includes a screen to login or register if the user was using the application for the first time. Then there needed to be a screen asfter the login to display a table of the inputted weights with buttons to add a daily weight, edit the table or add a goal weight. There also needed to be a screen to show settings for the user to turn on or off notifications allow the app to send an SMS message when the user did reach their goal weight. My UI design kept users in mind by keeping the desing simple and ensure the users were not going to be overwhelmed with information upon opening the application. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

In the developement of the app, there were multiple steps to approaching the design and development. Starting with research and analyzing what the requirements were of the client and the user to ensure all functionality was being met as required. Then came the design phase, where I imagined how I wanted the app to look and researching how I would achieve that goal through Android Studio and utlizing coding best practices. These practices can continuously be applied in the future to all development projects whether front-end or back-end.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Testing to ensure my code was functional included rebuilding and compiling the application after all changes to ensure the app was still functional and there were no exceptions being thrown. Also, developing in small sections to focus on one aspect at a time. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

For me the biggest challenge was not overcoming coding challenges, but rather personal challenges. Throughout this term I moved myself and my family to Japan with the Navy and settled into a new home in a new country. During this process, there was also a possibility of being flown out to the aircraft carrier I am stationed on to immediately deploy, which brought added stress and time constraits to my project development. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Where I thought I was successful was in the login portion of the application, being able to make the registration or login fucntional as necessary.
